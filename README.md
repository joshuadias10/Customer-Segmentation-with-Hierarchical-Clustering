# Hierarchical Clustering on Shopping Data

## Overview

This repository features a Python script for Hierarchical Clustering applied to shopping data. Using scikit-learn and scipy, the script performs clustering analysis, visualizes the data with a dendrogram, and segments customers based on annual income and spending score.

## Files

- `Hierarchical_Clustering.ipynb`: Python script that handles data loading, preprocessing, and clustering. It includes visualization of clusters using a dendrogram and scatter plot.

## Dataset

The script works with a CSV file named `shoppingdata_hierarchical.csv`. Ensure your dataset includes relevant columns for clustering (e.g., Annual Income and Spending Score). Adjust the script if your dataset format differs.

## Installation

To run the script, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`

## Example Output
- **Dendrogram**: Visualizes the clustering process and aids in selecting the number of clusters.
- **Scatter Plot**: Shows how customers are grouped into clusters based on their features.
